# Matrix-Addition
A C program to perform addition of two matrices of the same order using nested loops.


üìñ Overview
This project demonstrates a simple C program that performs addition of two matrices of the same dimensions.
The program takes user input for both matrices and adds their corresponding elements to form a third matrix ‚Äî the sum matrix.

‚öôÔ∏è Features
Accepts two matrices of equal size from the user.
Adds corresponding elements using nested loops.
Displays all three matrices (first, second, and result).
Works for both square and rectangular matrices.

üíª Code Logic
Input the number of rows and columns for the matrices.
Take elements for the first and second matrices.
Add elements position-wise using a nested for loop.
Display the resulting sum matrix.
